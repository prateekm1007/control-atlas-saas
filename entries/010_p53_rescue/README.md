# Atlas Entry #010: The Rescue (p53 Y220C)

**"The Molecular Keystone"**

## 1. Intent
To demonstrate **Platform Generalization**. We move beyond KRAS inhibition to p53 stabilization.
The Y220C mutation creates a surface crevice that lowers the protein's melting temperature, causing it to unfold and fail.

## 2. Technical
*   **Structure:** p53 Y220C + Ligand (`6FKB`)
*   **Mechanism:** Pharmacological Chaperone / Stabilization.
*   **Visual:** The Drug (Cyan) fills the mutation-induced cavity (Red), acting as a structural keystone.

## 3. Insight
Control is bidirectional. We can freeze a moving protein (KRAS), or we can solidify a melting protein (p53). The Atlas maps both.
