# Control Atlas — Investor Pitch Outline

## 1. Problem
- Drug discovery wastes 80–95% of compute and chemistry
- Resistance discovered *after* clinical failure

## 2. Insight
> Geometry finds candidates; physics decides control

## 3. Solution
Control Atlas — a deterministic compiler for druggability:
- Finds control sites
- Rejects bad chemistry
- Predicts resistance pre-emptively

## 4. Proof
- Sotorasib recovered without tuning
- 90% docking reduction
- Resistance predicted before emergence

## 5. Market
- Oncology (KRAS, kinase resistance)
- Protein–protein interaction targets
- Undruggable target revival

## 6. Product
- CLI / API Gatekeeper
- Enterprise screening pipeline
- Target-specific physics grammars

## 7. Business Model
- Platform licensing
- Target-specific exclusivity
- Co-development partnerships

## 8. Moat
- Physics-enforced search space
- Resistance-aware grammar
- Deterministic reproducibility (non-AI hype)

## 9. Ask
- Seed / Strategic partnership
- Pilot programs with pharma
