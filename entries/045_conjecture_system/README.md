# Entry 045 — Conjecture System

This system generates falsifiable scientific questions from accumulated failures.

## Conjecture Types
- **Near-Miss:** Hypotheses that failed exactly one constraint. (High value for optimization).
- **Dominant Failure:** Constraints that reject the most candidates. (Suggests library bias or target difficulty).

## Philosophy
The system does not guess solutions.
It identifies where knowledge is missing or brittle.
