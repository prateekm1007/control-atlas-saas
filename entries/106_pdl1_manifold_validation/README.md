# Entry 106 — PD-L1 Manifold Validation

## Purpose
Pipeline sanity check following KRAS G12D veto.

## Baseline Motif
- GGYWP

## Results
- Tier 1 (Native Audit): 2.85 Å clearance
- Tier 2 (Implicit Micro-Burst, 100–200ps):
  - Stable potential energy (~ -27,800 kJ/mol)
  - No ballistic repulsion

## Conclusion
The Control Atlas sieve is not over-conservative.
When a physical manifold exists, it is detected and passed.

## Status
PD-L1 territory CONFIRMED OPEN for discovery.
