# Atlas Entry #011: The Control Motif (The Switch)

**"Not a Target — A Mechanism."**

## 1. Intent
This entry demonstrates that the Control Atlas maps **conserved control architectures**, not individual proteins.
KRAS and Gαs use the same mechanical switch logic to regulate biological state.

## 2. Technical
- **Structures:** KRAS (6OIM), Gαs (1AZS)
- **Alignment:** Constrained to the conserved G-domain core
- **Motifs:**
  - KRAS Switch I (30–38), Switch II (60–76)
  - Gαs Switch I (199–210), Switch II (227–242)

## 3. Insight
Nature reuses control logic.
If you can control the Switch motif once, you can control it everywhere it appears.
