# Atlas Entry #001: Wild-Type Baseline

**"The Statue"**

## 1. Biological Intent
This entry establishes the wild-type KRAS structure in its GDP-bound, inactive form.
It defines the geometric baseline against which all mutant, drug-bound, and effector-bound
states are compared.

* **Primary State:** KRAS WT + GDP
* **Role:** Structural reference
* **Key Insight:** Switch regions are compact and non-signaling.

## 2. Technical Implementation
* **Structure:** Canonical WT KRAS (GDP-bound)
* **Rendering:** Clean cartoon representation with ligand visible
* **No mutation, no effector, no drug**

## 3. Automation
* **Script:** atlas_entry_001_auto.cxc
* **Logic:** Load → Clean → Render → Save
