# Entry 105 — KRAS G12D × Chai-1 Manifold Collapse

## Classification
- Type: TERMINAL VETO
- Scope: Generator-Specific
- Generator: Chai-1
- Target: KRAS G12D (Switch II)

## Evidence Summary
Across v6–v8 iterations, we varied:
- Motif length: 4-mer → 8-mer
- Buffer length: GG → GGGG
- Side-chain chemistry: Arg → Lys
- Tail removal: DVP deleted

Observed invariant outcome:
- Heavy-atom overlaps converging to 1.7–2.2 Å
- No configuration exceeded the 2.5 Å safety floor

## Conclusion (Negative Theorem)
For Chai-1, the KRAS G12D Switch II pocket is a hallucinated manifold.
The generator consistently places binders into a physically blocked volume.

## Governance Action
- KRAS G12D is BLACKLISTED for Chai-1
- All future proposals vetoed at Tier 0

## Rationale
This veto prevents repeated GPU expenditure on a collapsed manifold
and preserves compute sovereignty.
