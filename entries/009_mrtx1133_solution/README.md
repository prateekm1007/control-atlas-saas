# Atlas Entry #009: The Non-Covalent Solution (MRTX1133)

**"Breaking the Covalent Dogma"**

## 1. Intent
To demonstrate how KRAS G12D — long considered undruggable — can be targeted using
high-affinity **non-covalent chemistry**.

## 2. Structure
* **Complex:** KRAS G12D + MRTX1133
* **PDB:** 7RPZ

## 3. Mechanism
MRTX1133 does not rely on cysteine chemistry.
Instead, it forms a stabilizing **salt bridge and hydrogen-bond network** with the mutant
**Aspartate 12**, turning the resistance mutation into a binding anchor.

## 4. Insight
The mutation that broke first-generation inhibitors becomes the foundation of the next.
This represents the future of KRAS drug design.
