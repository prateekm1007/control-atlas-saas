# Atlas Entry #006: The Variant Gap (G12C vs G12D)

**"The Atomic Alibi"**

## 1. Intent
To demonstrate why a drug designed for G12C fails in G12D, despite 99% structural identity.
This entry visualizes the **Chemical Delta**: The switch from a nucleophilic Thiol (-SH) to a charged Carboxyl (-COO).

## 2. Structures
*   **G12C:** `6OIM` (Gray)
*   **G12D:** `4DSN` (Blue)

## 3. Insight
The G12C inhibitor relies on a covalent bond to the Sulfur atom (Yellow).
In G12D, this is replaced by Oxygens (Red), which offer no handle for the covalent warhead.
The Atlas visualizes this as a **missing port** in the control circuit.
