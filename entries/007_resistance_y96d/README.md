# Atlas Entry #007: The Resistance Forecast (Y96D)

**"The Escape Hatch"**

## 1. Intent
To demonstrate predictive power by simulating a secondary resistance mutation
(Y96D) on a drug-bound KRAS G12C structure.

## 2. Structure
- **Base:** KRAS G12C + AMG 510 (`6OIM`)
- **Mutation:** Tyr96 → Asp96 (in silico)

## 3. Insight
The Aspartate introduces charge and steric bulk into the Switch II pocket,
creating a direct clash with the inhibitor scaffold.
This mutation is a known clinical resistance mechanism.

## 4. Status
Predictive → Clinically Validated
