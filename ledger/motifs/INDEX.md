# Control Atlas Motif Ledger (v3.0)

A motif is counted only if it has ALL of the following:
1. Design intent (enumeration or FASTA)
2. Outcome (CIF/PDB or explicit failure)
3. Judgment (geometry / energy / MD)
4. Doctrine linkage (LAW / NKG)

Status codes:
- VERIFIED     : Passed geometry + MD
- REJECTED     : Failed geometry or kinetics
- BLACKLISTED  : Manifold retired
- PENDING      : Generated, not yet judged
