# Negative Knowledge: KRAS G12D Manifold Collapse

Status: BLACKLISTED
Law: LAW-105

Evidence:
- Multiple short-peptide probes (n≥9)

Observed:
- Heavy-atom overlap asymptote at ~1.74 Å
- No truncation or flexibility rescues geometry

Conclusion:
This manifold is structurally incompatible with Chai-1 priors.
Future compute here is permanently prohibited.
