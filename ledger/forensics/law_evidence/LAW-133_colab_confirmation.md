# LAW-133 — Colab T4 Confirmation

Flexible glycine-rich linkers (>8G) were tested under replicated physics.

Result:
- 100% steric collapse
- No surviving clearance events
- Confirms Entropy Paradox under independent hardware

This evidence upgrades LAW-133 from theoretical veto to replicated physical constraint.
