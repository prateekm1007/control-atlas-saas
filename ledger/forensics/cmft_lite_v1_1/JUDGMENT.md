Audit Set:
- PDL1_CTRL
- LAG3_CTRL
- TIM3_CTRL

Witnesses:
- Chai-1
- ESMFold

Results:
- PDL1_CTRL: 2.45 Å (metastable), pLDDT 60–70
- LAG3_CTRL: 1.52 Å (collapse)
- TIM3_CTRL: ~2.0 Å (collapse)

Conclusion:
Polyproline ≥5P induces intrinsic disorder (PPII manifold). Apparent clearance in diffusion models is a docking artifact.
