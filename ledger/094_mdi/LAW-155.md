# LAW-155: The Kinetic Arbitration Mandate

## Observation
Raw diffusion coordinate generation (Chai-1, AlphaFold-3) produces "static clashes" that do not represent the global energy minimum.

## Law
Tier 1 Geometric Audits require 100-step Amber14/OBC2 energy minimization for authoritative validation.

## Stability Signature Metric
A lead is designated as "Industrial Grade" only if it exhibits < 5% Contact Density loss during relaxation.

### Calculation
ρ_retention = (ρ_post / ρ_pre) × 100%
ρ_loss = 100% - ρ_retention

## Validated Leads (Cycle v5.0)

### CHAMP-005 (Metastable)
- Pre-minimization: ρ = 199
- Post-minimization: ρ = 147
- ρ_loss = 26%
- Classification: Metastable (fails <5% criterion)

### TwinRod-v2 (Industrial Grade)
- Pre-minimization: ρ = 336
- Post-minimization: ρ = 334
- ρ_loss = 0.6%
- Classification: Industrial Grade (stable interface)

## Interpretation
High ρ_loss indicates the predicted binding mode is energetically unfavorable. Low ρ_loss (<5%) indicates the predicted mode is physically stable.

## Implementation
All future leads must pass this criterion before progressing to Tier 2 (MD stability) or experimental validation.
