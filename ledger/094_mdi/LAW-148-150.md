# ⚖️ MDI Update: Cycle v4.8 (Structural Rigidity)

## LAW-148: Polyproline Disorder Veto
- **Definition:** Sequences with ≥ 5 consecutive prolines are designated as "Disorder Engines."
- **Effect:** Induces pLDDT < 70 and stochastic docking artifacts (< 2.0 Å) in diffusion models.
- **Veto Status:** ACTIVE. All 1D-Flexible Needle architectures are retired.

## LAW-149: Helical Prop Mandate
- **Definition:** Structural clearance for IgV targets must be enforced by rigid salt-bridge alpha-helical spacers (e.g., (EAAK)n).
- **Requirement:** Minimal admissible pLDDT for lead candidacy is 80.

## LAW-150: Axial Tilt Dominance
- **Definition:** Single-axis rigid props exhibit metastable basin bifurcation (Bimodal Clearance).
- **Corrective:** Geometric Determinism (SD < 0.1 Å) requires non-linear (Bipodal) stance.
