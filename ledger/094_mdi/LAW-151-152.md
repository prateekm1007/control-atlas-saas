# ⚖️ MDI Update: Cycle v4.9 (Geometry Generalization)

## LAW-151: The Lever Paradox
- **Evidence:** HELI_3x (1.68 Å collapse) vs HELI_2x (2.52 Å clearance).
- **Law:** 1D-Rigidity has a physical length limit. Beyond 2 repeats of (EAAK), the prop acts as a lever arm that reinforces axial collapse.

## LAW-152: Score-Clearance Decoupling
- **Evidence:** PDL1 (Score 0.36) vs LAG3 (Score 0.12) despite similar geometric fit.
- **Law:** Biological specificity in the IgV manifold is determined by the Model Confidence Score, not just steric standoff.
