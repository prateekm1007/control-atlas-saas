# Push log (EC-24) — append-only

- **Authorized credential names:** `OWNER-PAT-1` (the owner-supplied GitHub PAT; recorded by NAME only — the value is never written to any file, per the standing credential-containment rule).
- **Convention:** an entry is appended in the same push it describes, carrying branch, full SHA, the time the push is issued, and the credential name. The ref-update confirmation is verified post-hoc via `ls-remote` and recorded in the round report. Entries written after the fact are labeled `RECONSTRUCTED` (EC-18). Grammar matches `scripts/ci/evidence_sequence_check.py`: `## <ISO-8601 UTC> | <ENTRY-ID> | <verb> | <subject> | [RECONSTRUCTED]`.
- **Scope note:** this log starts 2026-10-20. Pushes before 2026-10-20 (if any) are out of its recorded scope; the 2026-10-19 unreported-push incident is recorded separately in `INCIDENT_RECORD.md` (branch `docs/owner-decisions`, evidence/incident-push/).

## 2026-10-20T06:06:00Z | P-011 | push | branch=proposal/ec16-ec26-enforcement sha=self-referential-tip credential=OWNER-PAT-1

- LIVE entry for this package's push. Self-reference limit, disclosed: an entry cannot contain the 40-hex SHA of the commit that first publishes it, so the subject carries the disclosed marker `self-referential-tip` (NOT a SHA) and the entry ships inside the commit it describes. The actual pushed tip is verified post-hoc via `ls-remote` immediately after the push and quoted in the worklog and round report (that verification record is written later and would be labeled RECONSTRUCTED if ever appended here).
