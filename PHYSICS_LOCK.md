The pocket physics computation is finalized using:
- Ligand-defined centroid anchoring
- Radius-based pocket atom selection (8 Å)
- Convex hull volume
- Neighbor-density exposure proxy
- Residue-based hydrophobic fraction

This model aligns with industry-standard pocket detection
and is required for all downstream grammar, resistance,
and generative logic.
