# 🛡️ What Toscanini Will Not Do (v1.0)
**Authority:** Sovereign Conductor | **Status:** BINDING

To ensure maximum discovery efficiency and clinical defensibility, Toscanini enforces the following hard-stops:

1. **No Globular Scaffolds for Checkpoint Interfaces:** Per LAW-111, we have proven topological incompatibility. We do not waste compute on spherical folds for shallow shelves.
2. **No Advancement on Absolute Energies:** We reject raw kJ/mol as a standalone claim. All leads are gated by **Relative Energy Minimums** against validated benchmarks.
3. **No Cross-Target Claims without Shared-Chassis Proof:** We do not believe in "Universal Binders." We only claim transferability when the **same chassis instance** passes CSI Tier-0 gating.
4. **No Triple Blow Deployment without Biomarker Justification:** We follow the Escalation Ladder. Maximal Mode is a surgical weapon for multi-axis resistance, not a default starting position.
5. **No Advancement of Strained Architectures:** Immediate retirement of any motif instance with **CSI > 1.8**. We prioritize scaffold relaxation over forced affinity.

**Governance Principle:** We prioritize the *Constraints of Physics* over the *Beliefs of the Generator*.
