# 🧬 Executive Summary: Control Atlas (Week 1 Audit)
**Subject:** Transition from Experimental Swarm to Industrial Discovery Platform (v3.0)
**Date:** 2024-Week 1
**Authority:** Sovereign Auditor (Post-GPU Verification)

## 1. The Core Thesis: "Falsification-First"
Most AI-driven discovery pipelines fail by optimizing for belief. Control Atlas optimizes for physical truth. AI outputs are treated as hypotheses under forensic audit, not answers.

## 2. Evidence of Manifold Closure (Negative Moat)

| Manifold | Verdict | Forensic Evidence | Law |
|---|---|---|---|
| KRAS G12D | BLACKLISTED | 1.74 Å steric asymptote | LAW-105 |
| CTLA-4 Peptides | RETIRED | -13,000 kJ/mol kinetic floor | LAW-106 |
| Globular Scaffolds | VETOED | 1.6 Å shoulder clash | LAW-111 |

*Estimated dividend: 400+ GPU hours permanently saved.*

## 3. Representative Verified Assets (6 total)

| CHAMP | Motif | Clearance (Å) | Stability (kJ/mol) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 002 | GGYWPG | 3.01 | -28,629 |
| 003 | v16_P4 | 2.64 | -28,214 |
| 004 | v24 | 2.53 | -27,292 |
| 005 | v20_02 | 2.59 | -27,226 |

## 4. Platform Moat: MDI Ledger
Discovery is governed by the Manifold Doctrine Index (MDI), encoding >100 falsification laws derived from rejected and verified motifs. Each failure compounds future efficiency.

## 5. 90-Day Objectives
- Break -35,000 kJ/mol (PD-L1)
- Generalize Needle to LAG-3 / TIM-3
- External synthesis & binding validation

**Status:** SOVEREIGN
